# Firebase Build Fix

## Issue
The Firebase build was failing with the following error:
```
Error [PrismaClientConstructorValidationError]: Invalid value undefined for datasource "db" provided to PrismaClient constructor.
It should have this form: { url: "CONNECTION_STRING" }
```

## Root Cause
During the Firebase build process, the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not available, causing Prisma to fail when trying to initialize the client during the build step.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Database Client (`lib/db.ts`)
- Added null checks for `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Created a `getPrismaClient()` helper function that throws an error if the database is not available
- Added error handling for Prisma client creation
- Made the client initialization more robust during build time

### 2. Updated All API Routes
- Replaced direct `prisma` imports with `getPrismaClient()` function calls
- Added proper error handling for database connection errors
- Each API route now checks for database availability before attempting operations

### 3. Build-Time Compatibility
- Added `getPrismaClientForBuild()` function for build-time compatibility
- Prisma client is only initialized when `DATABASE_URL` is available
- Build process can complete even without database connection

## Files Modified
- `lib/db.ts` - Main database client with improved error handling
- All API routes in `app/api/` - Updated to use new client pattern
- `scripts/update-prisma-imports.js` - Script to update all API routes

## Environment Variables Required
For Firebase deployment, ensure the following environment variables are set:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string

## Testing
The build now works locally and should work on Firebase with proper environment variable configuration.

## Next Steps
1. Set up environment variables in Firebase App Hosting
2. Deploy the application
3. Test database connectivity in the deployed environment
