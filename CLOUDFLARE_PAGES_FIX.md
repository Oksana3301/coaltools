# 🚨 Cloudflare Pages Wrangler Error Fix

## Problem Identified

The error shows that Cloudflare Pages is trying to use **Wrangler** (for Cloudflare Workers) instead of the proper **Next.js build process**. This happens when:

1. ❌ `wrangler.toml` file exists (confuses Cloudflare Pages)
2. ❌ Build command is set to `npx wrangler deploy`
3. ❌ Cloudflare Pages thinks it's a Workers project

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Wrangler Configuration
- **Deleted:** `wrangler.toml` (this was causing the confusion)
- **Reason:** Wrangler is for Cloudflare Workers, not Cloudflare Pages

### 2. Updated Cloudflare Pages Configuration
- **File:** `.cloudflare/pages.json`
- **Build command:** `npm run build:cloudflare`
- **Output directory:** `.next`
- **Node.js version:** 18

### 3. Verified Build Script
- **File:** `scripts/build-cloudflare.js`
- **Purpose:** Handles Prisma generation + Next.js build
- **Status:** ✅ Working locally

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Update Cloudflare Pages Settings

Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard and update:

**Build & Deploy Settings:**
```
Framework preset: Next.js
Build command: npm run build:cloudflare
Build output directory: .next
Node.js version: 18.x
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Make sure the build command is **NOT** `npx wrangler deploy`

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

In **Environment Variables** section:
```
NODE_ENV = production
DATABASE_URL = your_supabase_database_url
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = your_generated_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://your-domain.pages.dev
```

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy**
3. The build should now use the correct Next.js process

## 🎯 Expected Build Process

After the fix, your build should show:

```
✅ Installing dependencies
✅ Running: npm run build:cloudflare
✅ Generating Prisma client
✅ Building Next.js application
✅ Deploying to Cloudflare Pages
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't use `npx wrangler deploy` as build command
- ❌ Don't have `wrangler.toml` file in your project
- ❌ Don't set framework preset to "None"

## ✅ What TO Do

- ✅ Use `npm run build:cloudflare` as build command
- ✅ Set framework preset to "Next.js"
- ✅ Use `.next` as output directory
- ✅ Set Node.js version to 18.x

## 🔍 Verification

After applying these changes, your build logs should show:
- No Wrangler-related errors
- Next.js build process
- Prisma client generation
- Successful deployment
