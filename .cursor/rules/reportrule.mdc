Use a multi-tenant schema (orgs, memberships, profiles) so one codebase can serve many sites/teams securely.

Store the 3 report pillars in separate tables with shared keys:

Cashout (kas besar/kas kecil) → cashouts + expense_categories

Production → production_reports

Salary/Payroll → employees, payroll_items

Keep onboarding answers in onboarding_answers (so AI knows preferences like Bahasa Indonesia, reminder via email, etc.).

Track file imports & AI outputs in files + ai_runs.

Enable RLS everywhere. Allow members of the same org to read, creator or admin to write, admin/owner to delete.

Seed 1 org (PT Global Lestari Alam), common expense categories, and a few example employees.

Replace '<YOUR-USER-UUID>' with your UUID from Supabase Auth → Users, so you become the initial owner.
